# Create users for alarm database
#
# Original version, 2009-03-05: chenx1@ornl.gov
# Updates: Kay Kasemir

# Before using this file to create config tables, you must change hostname, 
# username, password, database_name to the real name!

# Under the directory containing this file, use this command to execute the commands:
# mysql -h hostname -u root -p'the_mysql_root_password' < MYSQL_USER.sql

# Or copy/paste the sections of interest into a mysql shell.

# Then assert that the 'alarm' and 'report' accounts used
# by CSS clients have access to MySQL from remote computers.
# This might require a firewall exception for TCP 3306,
# the default MySQL server port. 

-- Create user 'alarm' with password '$alarm'
-- who can access the config tables remotely,
-- but only change the table layout locally
GRANT ALL ON ALARM.* TO 'alarm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$alarm';
GRANT ALL ON ALARM.* TO 'alarm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$alarm'; 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Allow user 'reports' to read from the alarm tables
-- Assuming  user 'report' already exists.
-- Otherwise create it by adding ... IDENTIFIED BY '$report';
GRANT SELECT ON ALARM.* TO 'report'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$report';
GRANT SELECT ON ALARM.* TO 'report'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$report';

-- Example for other user who can fully access the config tables remotely
#GRANT ALL ON ALARM.* TO username2@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#GRANT INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE ON alarm.* TO username2@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
